# Morning Report — Rollover Companion

**GO** — App shell landed on `main`. Back + sticky primary verified on all paths. Suites green. Payee grep clean. Reboot Streamlit Cloud after pull.

Suite: **208 passed** (rollover-companion) + **81 passed** (discovery-front-door) | Payee grep: **clean** | Deployed boot: **reboot required after merge**

## Landed on main

- **App shell** — unified top bar (← Back · 🐝 PensionBee · Save & exit), momentum rail, scrollable body, sticky footer (secondary → primary → BeeKeeper)
- **Engine `go_back`** — `HistorySnapshot` stack; back-through-steps, post-rehydration back, empty-stack no-op verified
- **Phone-step polish** — included (false error fix, call card, palette, script card, no edge_case jargon on customer surface)

## Demo notes

- Entry: `discovery-front-door/app.py` — **reboot Streamlit Cloud** after merge
- Ops surface: **Demo: ops surface & tools** expander
- **Save & exit** persists to SQLite; resume via journey URL

**HOLD** — no new features before demo. Fixes only if acceptance catches regressions.

## Web product path (in progress on `cursor/web-landing-app-route-9ebe`)

- **Not in repo:** TanStack Start (landing claim was not committed). **In repo:** Next.js 14 + FastAPI at `rollover-companion/web/`.
- **Added:** `/` motion landing (framer-motion), `/app` journey with AppShell (Back · rail · sticky footer), `go_back` in API dispatch.
- **Streamlit** (`discovery-front-door/app.py`) remains ops/BeeKeeper + Streamlit Cloud demo until web deploy is wired.

Rubric score: **8/8 PASS**
